# Relational data

The goal of this series is help you understand and work with multiple,
related tables of data.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   Understand the main ideas about relational data.
-   Work with relational data with the dplyr package.
-   Work with relational data with the dm package.
-   Work with a lazy, hosted database.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who works with two or more related tables of data.

## Why is this important?

> It’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data.
> Typically you have many tables of data, and you must combine them to
> answer the questions that you’re interested in. Collectively, multiple
> tables of data are called relational data because it is the relations,
> not just the individual datasets, that are important.
