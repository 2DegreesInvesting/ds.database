# Relational data with dplyr

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

[Relational data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html):

* A collection of related tables of data.

```{r}
companies <- tribble(
  ~companies_id,                                 ~information,
              1,    "alpha sells solar panels and wind mills",
              2, "beta sells steel and installs solar panels",
)

categories <- tribble(
  ~companies_id,       ~sector,
              1,      "energy",
              2,  "metallurgy",
              2,      "energy",
              3, "agriculture",
)
```

* The relations are always defined,  between a pair of tables, by the keys.

```{r}
key  <- "companies_id"

companies |>
  left_join(categories, by = key)
```

A realistic example:

### Mutating joins

Add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.

--

[Inner join](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#mutating-joins): Drop
unmatched rows.

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3abea0b730526c3f053a3838953c35a0ccbe8980/7f29b/diagrams/join-inner.png)

```{r}
companies |>
  inner_join(categories, by = "companies_id")
```

[Outter joins](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#outer-join):

* `left_join(x, y)`: Keep all rows in `x` (most common).
* `right_join(x, y)`: Keep all rows in `y`.
* `full_join(x, y)`: Keep all rows in `x` and `y`.

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c12ca9e12ed26a7c5d2aa08e36d2ac4fb593f1e/79980/diagrams/join-outer.png)

```{r}
companies |>
  left_join(categories, by = "companies_id")

companies |>
  right_join(categories, by = "companies_id")

companies |>
  full_join(categories, by = "companies_id")
```

* Duplicate keys in one table

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6faac3e996263827cb57fc5803df6192541a9a4b/c7d74/diagrams/join-one-to-many.png)

```{r}
companies2 <- companies |>
  bind_rows(tibble(companies_id = 1L, information = "abc"))

companies2 |>
  left_join(categories)
```

* Duplicate keys in both tables

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d37530bbf7749f48c02684013ae72b2996b07e25/37510/diagrams/join-many-to-many.png)

```{r}
categories2 <- categories |>
  bind_rows(tibble(companies_id = 1L, sector = "xyz"))

companies2 |>
  left_join(categories2)
```

### Filtering joins

Affect observations, not variables:

* `semi_join(x, y)`: Keep all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`.

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/028065a7f353a932d70d2dfc82bc5c5966f768ad/85a30/diagrams/join-semi.png)

```{r}
categories |> 
  semi_join(companies)
```

* `anti_join(x, y)`: Drop all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`.

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f29a85efd53a079cc84c14ba4ba6894e238c3759/c1408/diagrams/join-anti.png)

```{r}
categories |> 
  anti_join(companies)
```

### Validating keys to avoid [join problems](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#join-problems)

* All values of a primary key should be unique.

```{r}
companies |>
  count(companies_id) |>
  filter(n > 1)

# (!) The `companies_id` column is NOT a primary key of `categories`
categories |>
  count(companies_id) |>
  filter(n > 1)
```

* No value of a primary key should be missing.

```{r}
companies |>
  filter(is.na(companies_id))
```

* All values of a foreign key should match a value of a primary key.

```{r}
# ! Problem: Invalid foreign key
anti_join(categories, companies, by = "companies_id")
```
